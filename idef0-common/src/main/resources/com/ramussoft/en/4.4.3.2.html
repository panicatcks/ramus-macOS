<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in"><B>Text</B> is an
attribute to set a text, which will be showed in a report. Text can
contain a keywords, which will be used to show different data from a
project, like attributes of elements. A query and a keyword has to be
written in squared brackets, like “[QUERY.KEYWORD]”. A query in
the Text attribute has the same form as a query in a Table attribute
(see below). A keyword is written ofter a query with a dot. Thus, a
keyword specifies a text which should be inserted in the attribute.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">List of available
keywords:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>Name</B> is a name of current element.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>QualifierName</B> is a name of current
	element's qualifier (this should be written as one word
	“QualifierName”, any space is not available between “Qualifier”
	and “Name” parts of this word).</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>Code</B> is a code of current element.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>CodeIDEF0</B> is a code of current element,
	according to the IDEF0 notations [1].</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>SerialNumber</B> is a serial number of a row
	in a table. This keyword can be used only in tables. Beside a query
	before this keyword, must be exactly as the <B>Query</B> attribute
	of the table (see below).</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>“<B>A name of an attribute”</B>. You can
	use as a keyword any name of any attribute, to insert the attribute
	into the text. A name of an attribute has priority by comparison
	with others keywords. That's mean, if you use an attribute with name
	“Code”, for example, then keyword “Code” will be replaced
	with the attribute “Code”, but not with code of current element.</P>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">Queries with keywords
can be used in any part of a text. If you need to use symbols “[“
and “]” in the Text attribute, then, you should replace them with
 symbols “\[“ and “\]”. Analogically, you should use “\&lt;”,
“\&gt;”, “\\” instead of “&lt;”, “&gt;”, “\”
symbols.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">If a query and a keyword
forms for a Table object (see below), that the query have to be
started like a query for the table object.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">In hard need, for
additional formatting you can use HTML tags in a text. HTML tag
should be written between symbols “&lt;” and  “&gt;”. For
example, text “This &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; simple &lt;i&gt;text&lt;/i&gt;”
will be formatted as “This <B>is</B> simple <I>text</I>”. Only
formating HTML tags can be used, you can meet information about HTML
tags in additional documentation.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in"><B>Font</B> is an
attribute to set a font of the label.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in"><B>Size</B> is an

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in"><B>Connect with next
table.</B> If you set this attribute to “Yes”, then the label 
will be shown only if a table bellow has at least one row. If there
is no table below, value of this attribute is not important.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in"><B>Print for</B>. With
this attribute you can filter labels. If this attribute is empty,
then the label will be present for all elements.</P>
