<H1 CLASS="western">3. Graphical user interface</H1>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">Ramus has a flexible
graphical user interface, which can be customized on different needs
and wishes, by using dock-able windows (also can be called as
panels). Even if you have minimal computer knowledges, it is very
simple to change a look of the application.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">Every of main dock-able
window can be shown, by using a Windows menu (see above). Unneeded
dock-able windows can be hided. You can change a size and a positions
of each window. You can create a window which contains others windows
as tabs. Different sets of the windows and their positions are
gathered in workspaces. You can switch active workspace from a
windows menu (see above) or by using buttons on a top right corner of
the application.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">To move a dock-able
window, you should press left mouse button on its top and drag the
window. A transparent panel will show a position of the window when
the window will be dropped.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">Every dock-able window
has at least four commands to control its position, size and
visibility:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Move a window to a side of the main window of
	the application;</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Make a window as big as possible;</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Disconnect a window from the main window of the
	application;</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Remove a window from the main window of the
	application.</P>
</OL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">To create a window which
contains others windows, move any window on the top of another
window. This feature is not available for all combinations of
windows.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">If a dock-able window is
too thin to show all available commands on its top, then they are
available on right top corner of the window, as a pop-up menu. All
buttons always available on window as a context menu of window's top 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">Not to be confused in
the windows, you can switch any workspace, close all windows in the
workspace, then open all needed windows from windows menu one by one
and set an useful position and a size of every window.</P>
