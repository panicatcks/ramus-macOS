<H4 CLASS="western">4.1.2.2. Working with a list of elements</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">Elements can be moved up
and down in a list. To move an element, you should press left mouse
button on element's code field, and drag the field on a some
position. While dragging the element, a position where the element
can be drop will be marked with a horizontal line. It can be located
a simple list of elements and hierarchical tree of elements, in the
Elements window. To make a tree of elements drop an element on other
element.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">A node of every element
can be expanded or collapsed, by pressing left mouse button on expand
or collapse buttons (which mostly looks like “+” and “-”). To
expand or collapse all nodes use Collapse All or Expand All commands
(see above).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">As it was mentioned
above, you can set-up a hierarchical type (in the Table preferences
dialog). By default, elements have a Base hierarchy type. Base
hierarchy is a hierarchy created by a user. If a base hierarchy was
not edited, elements will be presented like a list. Beside base
hierarchy, you can create different types of the hierarchy, which
will be build automatically by some attributes.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">To create a new type of
hierarchy on the Table preferences dialog, in a hierarchy type field
select a New hierarchy type item. A Hierarchy type dialog will be
opened. In the dialog you can select attributes to build a new type
of hierarchy. On the left side of the dialog you will find all
attributes of a qualifier. With buttons “Move selected attributes
right”, “Move selected attributes left”, “Move selected
attributes up” and “Move selected attributes down” you can
set-up a list and order of attributes on the right side of the
dialog. The hierarchy will be build according to the right list of
attributes. Fist level of a new hierarchy will be build with the
first attribute in the list, the second level of hierarchy will be
build with the second attribute in the list, etc. After pressing OK
button, a new type of hierarchy will be presented in the Hierarchy
type field in the Table preferences dialog. You can replace any
hierarchy type by another in any time. To change a hierarchy type,
select it in the field and press Edit button (button with three
dots). To remove the hierarchy type, open the hierarchy type dialog
and remove all attributes from right side of the dialog.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">Of course, it is useful
to create a hierarchy type only for attributes with repeated values.
Every level of hierarchy will be grouped with some values.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">For example a qualifier
“Documents” has two attributes: “Name” and “Type”.
Obviously, no sense to include the “Name” attribute in a
hierarchy as values of the “Name” attribute are different for
different elements. But, values of the “Type” attribute can be
repeated for many elements. By creating a hierarchy with the
attribute “Type”, you will get a hierarchy with one level and all
elements will grouped with the same values of the attribute “Type”.
On the second level we will find elements (lines of documents).</P>
