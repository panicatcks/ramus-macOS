<H4 CLASS="western">4.3.2.5. Arrow context menu</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">Every Arrow has a
context menu. The context menu has items:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in"><B>Delete</B> is a
command to delete the arrow.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in"><B>Squiggle</B> is an
item to show or to hide squiggle. You can add squiggles with Squiggle
Tool (with this tool you can set a position a the squiggle). Adding
squiggles can improve a clarity of diagrams.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in"><B>Transparent text</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">
is an item to make a name of the arrow transparent or not
transparent. Sometime, this feature helps to improve a clarity of
diagrams.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in"><B>Arrow Tunnel</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">
is a command to use tunnels on diagrams [1]. The command is only
available on a snippet of the arrow in brackets. The snippet shows
arrow tunnel, which means that the arrow has a break. When you draw
an arrow to a diagram border in a decomposition diagram, a square
arrow tunnel is created. Likewise, if you delete an activity or
border arrow in a decomposition diagram, the arrow in the parent
diagram becomes a square tunnel. A square tunnel on an arrow stub
indicates that the arrow is unresolved within the model hierarchy,
which means there is no representation of the arrow in any other
diagram in the model.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">If
the arrow is drawn to a diagram border, the command opens a dialog
with two items: “Resolve </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">it
to border arrow”, “Mark it with tunnel” located. A selecting a
“Resolve it to border arrow” item lets to create a continue of
the arrow in a parent diagram. A selecting “Mark it with tunnel”
item lets to mark the arrow with rounded tunnel [1].</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in; font-weight: normal">If
the arrow is drown to an activity box, the command opens a dialog
with three items: “Resolve it to border arrow”, “Change it to
resolve rounded tunnel” and “Mark it with tunnel” located. A
selecting “Resolve it to border arrow” lets to create a continue
of the arrow in a decomposition diagram. A selection “Change it to
resolve rounded tunnel” lets to mark the arrow with rounded tunnel,
but the arrow in reports will be present in all activity boxed, that
are childish to a drown activity box. This feature should be used in
the list resort. A selecting “Mark it with tunnel” lets to mark
the arrow with rounded tunnel [1].</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in"><B>Edit active element</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">
is a command to open a dialog with an arrow preferences. The dialog
can be opened by double clicking on the arrow. The dialog contains
tabs with arrow look preferences and a “Stream” tab.</SPAN></P>
