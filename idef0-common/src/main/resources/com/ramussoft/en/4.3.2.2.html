<H4 CLASS="western">4.3.2.2. Adding objects on diagrams</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">You can add objects on
diagrams with applicable tools (chapter 2.3).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">This instruction does
not give an information IDEF0 [1] and DFD notations. To get
information about these notations see relative documents.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">It is important to
notice, that Ramus lets to show pass-throw objects on IDEF0 and DFD
diagrams, by creating off-page references of arrows. It means, that
arrows (streams) can be created not only in a main hierarchy of
diagrams, but can be created throw any diagram hierarchy, which are
located on different nodes of a model. To create such an arrow, you
should open two different diagrams on two different tabs, start
creating of a new arrow on one diagram and end the creating on
another diagram. When you finish the creating, the arrow will be
tunneled on two diagrams, and you will see label, which shows nodes,
where the arrow has a continue. To mark such a type of a tunnel,
Ramus uses a round.</P>
