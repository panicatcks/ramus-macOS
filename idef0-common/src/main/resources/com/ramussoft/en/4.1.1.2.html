<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">Qualifiers can be moved
up and down in a list of qualifiers. To move a qualifier, you should
press left mouse button on a qualifier's code field, and drag the
qualifier on some position. While dragging the qualifier, a position
where the qualifier can be drop will be marked with a horizontal
line.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">Simple list of
qualifiers and hierarchical tree of qualifiers can be located in the
Qualifiers window. To create a group of qualifiers, a new line of a
qualifier should be created in qualifiers window, and the qualifiers
should be moved on this line. To create a group you should drop a
qualifier just on the line of the group unlike to the moving the
qualifier up and down. To remove a qualifier from the group just drug
it somewhere in the list of qualifiers. If a group of qualifiers is
already exists, you can add new qualifiers to the group by dropping
them between qualifiers, that already present in the group.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.38in">A line of every group
can be expanded or collapsed, by pressing left mouse button on expand
or collapse buttons (which mostly looks like “+” and “-”).
